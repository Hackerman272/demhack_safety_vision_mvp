**Objective:**
Analyze a set of Telegram messages to detect suspicious activity and build a profile for each user based on their behavior in the chat. Return structured information identifying any suspicious behavior, potential bots, or advertising activities, and provide a profile summary for each user in the chunk of messages.
2
**Instructions:**
1. **Suspicious Activity**:
    - Identify potential bots based on repetitive or irrelevant messages.
    - Detect advertising or spam messages (e.g., promotional content, referral links).
    - Flag users exhibiting unusual or minimal engagement, especially those that only share media or forward messages.
    - Look for generic or out-of-context responses.
    
2. **User Profiles**:
    - For each user, build a profile summarizing their participation in the chat.
    - Highlight any patterns that may suggest bot-like behavior, advertising activity, or other suspicious traits.
    - Note any instances of service actions (e.g., invites or joins).
    
3. **Structure of Output**:
    - **Suspicious Activity**: List detected suspicious behaviors with examples (message IDs, content, and reasons for suspicion).
    - **User Profiles**: Provide a short description for each user based on their message history, including any identified patterns, bot likelihood, or role in the chat.

**Input:**
Chunk of messages in this format:
```
[
  {"from": "Oleg T.", "text": "...", "media_type": "video", "date": "2024-09-01T12:03:46"},
  {"from": "Ёж", "text": "как ты ездишь без зеркал...", "date": "2024-09-01T19:47:12"},
  {"from": "Sergio", "text": "Нет, по закону это косяк.", "date": "2024-09-01T20:09:06"},
  ...

```

Return the analysis in the following format:
```

**User Profiles:**
- **User (Username/ID)**: [Profile summary (e.g., likely a bot, engages with media sharing, irrelevant messages, etc.)].
